Hello! These are some code samples I used or modified for learning purposes from the [Hashicorp Terraform Associate learning path](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-associate-tutorials-003) on the Hashicorp developer documentation website.

I **do not** give permission for reusing this code, all IP and copyright for these materials belongs to Hashicorp, Inc. besides a few modifications I made while preparing for the Terraform Associate certification exam. I have made this repo public as an example of working with AWS resources and services via Terraform.
